# es-theme-epic-optimizedportable-RG351PM
Emulation Station theme for 480x320 resolution (e.g. ANBERNIC RG351P RG351M).
With full coverage of the main classic portable systems.
General UI optimizations and also improvements/changes to the portable systems support and artwork.
(fork of the EpicNoir and EpicCody optimized to an even better experience on the RG351M/P)

This would have not been possible without the previous Epic Noir and Epic Cody,
so thank you very much for all the people who made those excellent themes.

Changes (system-wide):
- 50% reduction in disk usage (360MB -> 180MB) only by using PNG optimization (tinyPNG)
- Clearer / better fonts readability overall;
- Moved stuff out from behind the bottom "help" area or the upper "clock" area;
- Better alignment/tweaking of some UI elements;
- No more UI border blocking the lower-right part of videos;
- Corrected spelling "Favorites games" -> "Favorite Games";
Changes (portable systems themes):
- Added support for Pokemon Mini and Watara Supervision systems;
- Brought back some system posters from EpicNoir;
- New original system posters (Gameboy Color, WonderSwan, Supervision, Last Played, Favorites);
- New original icons (controllers) for Pokemon Mini, Supervision, Last Played, Favorites;
